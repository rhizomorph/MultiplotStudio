FIXED   Highlights with 0 members are no longer listed in plot's legend.
FIXED   P-value multiple tests adjustment parameter reintroduced.
ADDED   Cardinality calculation - used for sparse (mostly 0s) and ragged (missing values/NaNs) datasets. Quantifies how many replicates within a class have values (as a count or as a percentage).
ADDED   Parameter for Expression calculation (which is now called Value) to specify whether or not NaN values are ignored when calculating class/multi-class means.
ADDED   Multi-class Min as new scope for calculations Value and Cardinality.
ADDED   Ability to toggle between applying filters as intersection OR union.
ADDED   Ability to hide inactive filters and highlights.
ADDED   Ability to sort columns in data browser by cardinality (if working with ragged or possibly sparse matrix).

MOD     Data browser layout made more compact.


Mar/27/2014
====================
FIXED   Bug in which Add New Criterion button remained disabled if the current criterion was an ID match (preventing ID matches to be combined with any other criteria in the same list).
FIXED   Text annotations corresponding to points that have been filtered out were still being displayed.
ADDED   Ability to sort the columns of the heatmap table by: 1) column name or 2) the value of a selected row.
ADDED   Ability to specify an ID-based list as inclusive or exclusive (i.e. include all, exclude all).


Mar/24/2014
====================
FIXED   Error in which highlights/filters created from non-file-based sources (i.e. user entered or from selection) when the probe ID contained lower case letters would return no hits.
MOD     Internal: several threading issues addressed to avoid possible race conditions and asynchronous glitches.
MOD     Changed default sample/population selection behavior - now, nothing is selected by default, user is explicitly asked which samples to include. Also, a CLS is loaded after samples are selected, the same populations will be reselected after loading class file.
MOD     Removed "adjustment" parameter for Pvalue until better worked out.


Mar/18/2014
====================
FIXED   Performance optimizations.
MOD     Internal: changed sort algorithm from QuickSort to HeapSort due to stack overflow with very large arrays containing many duplicate values (e.g. a pvalue with several thousand probes equal to 1).


Mar/13/2014
====================
MOD     Revamped interval slider in Filter/Highlights dialog: 1) added ability to define open/closed intervals, 2) fixed issue where users could slide boundaries past east other, 3) significantly optimized performance.
FIXED   Parsing error for certain non-numeric data columns in a CSV file.
FIXED   Density calculation (advanced shading) misinterpreting axis scale for Pvalues.


Feb/14/2014
====================
ADDED   Diagonal FC guide lines on Expression/Expression plots.
ADDED   Calculation scope "N-class Max" to several calculations.

FIXED   Filters/highlights not properly updating after being reordered.
FIXED   Bug related to changing a sample's data type when no CLS file has been specified.
FIXED   Various UI bugs.


Jan/23/2014
====================
ADDED   Implemented sample/population selection options.
ADDED   Support for CSV data files with additional annotation columns (assumes presence of header row!).
ADDED   Data Type specification for all samples/populations. This allows Multiplot Studio to calculate the appropriate class means and choose an appropriate default axis scale.
ADDED   Summary table with ability show additional annotation columns present in CSV.


Jan/06/2014
====================

MOD     Performance optimization of Quick Search function.
MOD     Performance optimization of plot repainting in response to highlight modifications.
MOD     Performance optimization in resizing plots (temporarily deactivating antialiasing while being resized).

FIXED   Temp folders not being deleted.


Nov/12/2013
====================
MOD     Replaced color chooser.


Nov/11/2013
====================
FIXED   Issue where some annotations would disappear.
FIXED   Issue with annotations being unselected if attempting to customize a group of annotations by right-clicking if Shift wasnt being pressed (Shift should not be necessary if the right-click was done on one of the selected annotations).


Nov/8/2013
====================
ADDED   Copy values in summary table - Ctrl-C to copy unmodified values, or Shift-Ctrl-C to copy formatted values (e.g. for fold changes).
ADDED   Quick search function. Easily create a highlight from an on-the-fly user search.
ADDED   SVG export now available. Does not yet correctly render gradient legends for plots using advanced shading.
MOD     Plot data dialog is no longer modal (i.e. user can interact with main desktop while dialog is still open).


Nov/5/2013
====================
MOD     Enable/disable behavior of filters and highlights. Now, global activation is the default, single plot activation is accessible via popup menu. This is the oppisite of prior behavior.
MOD     Performance enhancement related to global enable/disabling of filters & highlights.
